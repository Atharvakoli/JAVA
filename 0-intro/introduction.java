// Introduction to java
/*
 * B led to C, C let to C++, C++ set the statge of Java
 * C Was powerful efficient and structured language - still the problem was
 * complexity-December 1989
 * C with classes introduced as c++, but not better for internet early 1990's
 * Java was introduced by James Gosling, Patrik Naughton and many more in 1995
 * 
 * PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE, MULTI-THREADING, SECURITY, SIMPLE TO LEARN, TRULY
 * OBJECT ORIENTED, ROBUST
 * 
 * WHY JAVA
 * Easy to learn
 * -> Java doesn't require you to know anything about memory management to get
 * started
 * -> Java is simplier, the syntax is much more readable than C, C++ or auy
 * other language
 * -> Java is a strongly, typed language, which catches many newbie mistakes.
 * -> Java Compiler will point out where exactly you have mistakes.
 * 
 * JAVA CAN DO EVERYTHING
 * HUGE COMMUNITY
 * Android
 * JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
 * PLATFORM INDEPENDENT
 * 
 * WHAT you can implement with Java
 * Desktop applications
 * mobile applications
 * web applications
 * 
 * JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE, JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT AND JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
 * 
 * JVM -> This is program which is responsible for converting Byte code to
 * machine specific code
 * You compile your source code to java bytecode --> you execute your bytecode
 * on JVM.
 * The JVM is used for both - translate the bytecode into machine language for a
 * particular computer, and actually execute the corresponding machine-language
 * instructions as well.
 * 
 * JRE -> JRE includes JVM in itself PLUS java binaries and classes which are
 * needed to execute program.
 * 
 * JVM -> JDK contains JVM JRE PLUS all tools which are necessary for
 * development of java programs

 * What are console applications
 * A console application is an application to work with data input and output in
 * command line
 * console application does't have GUI
 * Mostly used for education pur
 * 
 * INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
 * 
 * 
 * Charactristics
 * Object oriented Language
 * Clean, Usable programmatic Approach to objects,
 * Simple
 * If you know basic of programming, learning java is much easier
 * secure
 * Provides firewell between networked application and your computer
 * use without virus
 * Protable
 * Executable code on all platforms
 * Robust
 * It checks your code at compile time and give error free code before execution
 * E.g. memory allocation and deallocation
 * Multithreaded
 * Programs that do multiple things simultaneously
 * Architectural-Neutral
 * Write once, run anywhere, anytime forever
 * interpreted
 * Create cross platform programs by creating bytecode
 * interprete that on my machine having JVM
 * High Performance
 * Java bytecode can be easily translated to native machine code
 * Distributed
 * Designed for distributed environment of internet
 * Cynamic
 * Java program Carry run time information
 * small fragments of bytecode may be dynamically updated on runnning system
 * 
 * Overview of Java
 * 
 * Object Oriented programming language
 * 1. Abstraction
 * 2. Encapsulation
 * 3. Polymorphism
 * 4. Inheritance
 * 5. First Simple Program in Java
 * 6. Two control blocks
 * 7. Lexical issues
 * Whitespace
 * identifiers
 * Literals
 * Comments
 * Seperators
 * keywords
 * 
 * Two models
 * All Programs consists of code and data
 * Process Oriented Model - what is happening. Series of Steps (Code)
 * Object oriented - data is binded on its data(object) who is being affected
 * Objects and set of well defined interfaces on that object
 * 
 * Abtraction
 * Complexity is hidden using Abstraction
 * While driving a Car we only care about its model, not a complex structure
 * From Outside, car is a single object.
 * When ectered you see steering, breaks sound systems and so on
 * Complex structure is simplified using hirarchical Abstraction
 * 
 * Three OOP Principles
 * 1. Encapsulation
 * Binds together code and Data
 * Keeps safe from outside interferenceand misuse
 * Access to code is controlled through interface
 * class binds data and code together
 * 
 * Inheritance
 * One Object acquires properties of another object
 * Inherited class have to define only its own unique properties within the
 * class
 * All world contains Animals
 * Characteristics are size, intelligence and type of skeletal systems
 * Behavioral: Eat, breathe and sleep
 * For Particular animal - particular uniqueness is there
 * 
 * Polymorphism
 * One interface is used for general class of actions
 * you define one interface and multiple actions, rest is to be done by compiler
 * Dog's sense of smell is Polymorphic.
 * If it smells a cat, it will bark and run after it
 * But if it smells a food, it will salivate and run to its bowl
 * smell is same, data to be operated on is different
 * 
 * Atomic Elements of java
 * 1. Whitespaces
 * Each line of code should be seperated by whitespace
 * 2. Identifiers
 * Classnames, method names and variables names Can contain descriptive sequence
 * of uppercase letters, lowercase letter, numbers or underscores and doller
 * sign characters Must not begin with number case sensitive
 * 
 * Literals
 * Constant value is Literal
 * 100 98.6 "X" "This is a test"
 * Comments
 * Single Line Comment //
 * Multiline Comment
 * Documentation comment
 * 
 * Seperators
 * () -> Parentheses
 * {} -> Braces
 * [] -> Brackets
 * ; -> Semicolon
 * , -> Comma
 * . -> period
