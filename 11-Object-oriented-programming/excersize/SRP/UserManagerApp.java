public class UserManagerApp {
    // This class contains the main method and serves as the entry point for the
    // application.

    // It demonstrates how to use the UserRegistration and UserAuthenticator classes
    // to register and authenticate users.

    // In the main method, a username and password are provided, and the
    // registerUser method is called to register the user.

    // Subsequently, the authenticateUser method is called to authenticate the user
    // based on the provided credentials.

    // By separating the application logic from the core functionalities of user
    // registration and authentication, this class promotes a modular and
    // maintainable codebase.

    // Overall, by adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and
    // separating distinct responsibilities into separate classes, the solution
    // enhances modularity, readability, and maintainability of the code. Each class
    // has a clear and single purpose, making the codebase easier to understand,
    // test, and extend.
