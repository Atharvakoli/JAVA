public class UserValidator {
    // This class is responsible for validating user input, specifically the
    // username and password.

    // It contains two static methods, validateUsername and validatePassword, which
    // check if the provided username and password meet certain criteria, such as
    // length and character requirements.

    // Separating the validation logic into its own class promotes reusability and
    // ensures that validation rules are applied consistently throughout the
    // application.
