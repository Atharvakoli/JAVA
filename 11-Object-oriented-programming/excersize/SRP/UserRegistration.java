package excersize.SRP;

public class UserRegistration {
    // This class handles the responsibility of registering users.

    // The registerUser method takes a username and password as input, validates
    // them using the UserValidator class, and registers the user if the input
    // passes validation.

    // If the input fails validation, the method returns false, indicating that the
    // registration process failed.

    // By separating user registration logic into its own class, we isolate this
    // functionality and make it easier to understand and maintain.
