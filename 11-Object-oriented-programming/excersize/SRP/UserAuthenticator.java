public class UserAuthenticator {
    // This class is responsible for authenticating users.

    // The authenticateUser method takes a username and password as input and
    // verifies them against predefined credentials (simulated in this example).

    // If the provided username and password match the predefined credentials, the
    // method returns true, indicating successful authentication.

    // Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the authentication process
    // failed.

    // Separating authentication logic into its own class allows for better
    // organization and encapsulation of this functionality.
